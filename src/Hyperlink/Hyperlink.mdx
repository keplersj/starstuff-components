# Hyperlink

The Hyperlink component is a plain ol' anchor hyperlink, with some nice styling thrown in. Its default appearance is very minimal, with some box-shadow color changes when interacted with.

## Basic Usage

<Playground>
  <Hyperlink href="#">Test</Hyperlink>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Hyperlink} />
