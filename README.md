# Starstuff Components

Minimalistic Web Components Library

## Philosophy

This library wants to stay out of your way. It provides some sensible defaults in the form of CSS and that's about it. It doesn't care about how you theme it, and doesn't require any special pipelines. These components are exactly how they appear.

The most notable "theming" feature of these components is their automatic dark mode, triggered by CSS media query.

## Installation

```shell
npm install starstuff-components
```

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c);

## Usage

All components can be access via named exports on the `starstuff-components` package. Detailed examples for each component can be seen below.
